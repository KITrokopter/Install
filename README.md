Install scripts

Supported versions: Ubuntu 12.04, 12.10, 13.04 (13.10 not supported by ROS yet)

Run from whereever you want.

First install kitrocopter, then dev environment.
If you want to, you can also install eclipse.

You may be asked something about "hddtemp". No is just fine.

After finishing the workspace will be in ~/ros_ws. Do not change the directory name, ros won't find your packages if you do.
